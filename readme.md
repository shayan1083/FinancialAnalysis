A project to learn about time series analysis and some machine learning applications for financial data.

Possible Applications
1) Daily Returns

2) Volatility:
- The extent of price fluctuations over a certain period of time. Forecasting volatility helps traders assess risk by showing how much they can expect the assets price to vary in the future.
- Models like ARCH can be used to forecast volatility, which captures patterns in how periods of high volatility tend to be followed by more high volatility
- High expected volatility could suggest larger price moves, making options trading more attractive
- Low expected volatility could suggest smaller price moves, making conservative trading more attractive

3) Price Trends:
- Trends indicate the generate direction in which the market is moving
- Moving averages, exponential moving averages, MACD, or trendlines are used to identify these trends
- If there is an uptrend, traders may look to buy on pullbacks (buying the dip)
- If there is a downtrend, they may consider shorting or using inverse ETFs
- During Sideways movements, strategies like selling options may be more effective

4) Market Regimes:
- Market regimes classify the broad condition of the market into different phases like bullish (upward trend), bearish (downward trend), or sideways (no clear trend)
- Regime-switching models (ex: Markov-switching models) or simple trend-following techniques can ebe used to identify these states
- In bullish markets, momentum based strategies that follow trends tend to work well
- In bearish markets, capital preservation strategies may be more effective

5) Exchange Rate Forecasting:
- Exchange rates represent the value of one currency relative to another. These rates are influenced by factors like interest rates, trade balances, and geopolitical events
- Exchange rates exhibit trends over time
- In an appreciating trend, traders may buy the stronger currency
- In a depreciating trend, traders may sell or short the weaker currency
